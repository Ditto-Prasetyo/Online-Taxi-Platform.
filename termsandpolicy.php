        <h1 class="title">Specific Terms for the Online Taxi Platform Service</h1>
        <p class="text-right"><em>Last updated on July 15<sup>th</sup>, 2024</em></p>
        
        <h2 class="section-title">1. Definition</h2>
        <p>
            Unless otherwise specified in these specific terms for the Online Taxi Platform service, defined terms in the main terms of use shall have the same meanings in these specific terms for the Online Taxi Platform service.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Taxi Driver" means a taxi driver who is registered with the Company pursuant to the terms and conditions between the Company and the taxi driver, as specified in the Online Taxi Platform Driver Application Terms of Use, in order to provide the Online Taxi Platform Service to the User.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Online Taxi Platform Service" means the transportation service for taxi passengers whereby the User can hail the Taxi Driver to pick up and drop off the User at the destination but shall not include delivery of goods or things.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Online Taxi Platform Driver Application" means the application or the website developed, owned and operated by the Company as a technological platform used as an intermediary for the Taxi Driver to manage and provide the Online Taxi Platform service.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">2. Agreement</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to the terms of the main terms of use, the User of the Online Taxi Platform service agrees to comply with the following terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.1</strong> The Company is merely an information provider and technological operator to facilitate contact and submission of transportation service requests that are sent from customers to the Taxi Drivers with the function of estimating duration for the pick-up and transportation and providing information to contact the Taxi Driver. However, the Company is not a transportation service provider, nor does it provide a service or any act which would be deemed that the Company is a transportation service provider or taxi service provider. The Company is not involved in the transportation service itself and is not responsible for the transportation service. Any transportation service is an independent and direct affair between a customer and the Taxi Driver.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.2</strong> The User shall not use the Online Taxi Platform service to deliver products or things in any case. If there is an occurrence of issue from the use of the Online Taxi Platform service to deliver products or things, the Company shall not hold any responsibility in any case and a driver has the right to reject the request.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2.3</strong> The transportation service shall be deemed the Taxi Driver's independent provision of service and not the Company's service. When the Taxi Driver accepts the User's request for the Online Taxi Platform Service, the User will see the initial information about the Taxi Driver, such as license plate number; vehicle color; telephone number; and any rating score (if any). The User considers and accepts transportation services and voluntarily accepts any risk that may arise from the Taxi Driver's transportation service on their own. The Company shall not have any duties and responsibilities, whether directly or indirectly, for any damage arising from special circumstances with regard to the Taxi Driver's actions and/or omission of services to the customer and/or breach of agreement; and/or wrongful act as committed by the Taxi Driver, such as loss of or damage to the User's luggage or property, the Taxi Driver's delay or misconduct in providing the service, any damage or trouble with the vehicle or taxi, or missing important events, meetings, or flights due to a delay in services. The User agrees not to make any claim against the Company.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">3. Denial of Warranty</h2>
        <p>
            The Company hereby fully denies any involvement with any transportation service for passengers or luggage of the User which is unlawful or carried out illegally in any respect.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">4. Use of Service</h2>
        <p>
            When the User presses the button "Request Taxi" to confirm use of the Online Taxi Platform service, the system will automatically send the request to the Taxi Driver. The purpose of the Online Taxi Platform service is to facilitate the User in submitting the request and contacting the Taxi Driver for passenger transportation services via taxi. The Online Taxi Platform service is a passenger transportation service, not a delivery service.
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>5.1</strong> The User shall pay the service fee for requesting the Online Taxi Platform Service via the application based on the rate that is shown to the User before using the service, and the transportation fee as shown on the ordinary taxi's meter.

            <strong>5.2</strong> The User shall be responsible for all road congestion, toll, expressway and/or highway fees.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5.3</strong> The User may pay for the service fee and transportation fee by cash or via Rabbit LINE Pay or any other methods as adjusted by the Company from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5.4</strong> The User shall be solely responsible for any expense in communicating with the Taxi Driver.
